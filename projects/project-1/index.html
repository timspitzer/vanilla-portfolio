              is a surveillance software that aims to provide a user-friendly
              and aesthetically pleasing solution for monitoring a variety of
              cameras from different manufacturers. It was developed during my
              time at Spreewunder for
              <a href="https://www.adeck-systems.de">Adeck Systems GmbH</a>.

            <h4>My contribution</h4>
            <p>
              As the frontend developer on the
              <a href="https://www.adeck-systems.de/produktportfolio"
                >Videoüberwachung 2.0</a
              >
              project, my role involved working with other developers and the
              design team to create the software.
            </p>
            <p>
              This included following the design guide to accomplish the overall
              look and feel of the software, as well as implementing the user
              experience. I also developed interactive features and
              visualizations to enhance the functionality of the software. I
              worked closely with the backend developers to ensure that the
              frontend interface was properly integrated with the underlying
              system. My duties also included testing the software to ensure
              that it was user-friendly and performed well, as well as
              troubleshooting and debugging any issues that arose.
            </p>
