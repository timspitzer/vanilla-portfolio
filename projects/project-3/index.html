            <h1>SECUVID</h1>

            <p>
              <a href="https://secuvid.com/">SECUVID</a>
              is a web-based video communication system that allows for easy
              communication with enhanced confidentiality protection. SECUVID
              uses end-to-end encryption to protect audio and video data,
              meaning that the communication data is not visible to anyone other
              than the participants in the conversation. The system is designed
              to be easy to use, works for both one-on-one and group
              conversations, and avoids compliance issues with regulations such
              as GDPR.

            <h4>My Contribution</h4>
            <p>
              As a frontend developer on the
              <a href="https://secuvid.com/">SECUVID</a>
              project, my role involved the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Set up application prototype, configured bundler (Rollup) , set
                up tools for testing (Storybook) and ensured consistent code
                style (ESLint, Prettier, Husky).
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented router logic, including guards for user
                authentication. Implemented translation (i18next). Implemented
                background blur functionality using MediaPipe framework in
                conjunction with Insertable Streams and OffscreenCanvas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented the use of Tailwind CSS, which resulted in a boost
                in development efficiency and a decrease in errors due to its
                functional design. Additionally, implemented the utilization of
                Redux for state management, which led to a decrease in errors
                caused by inconsistent application state.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collaborated closely with the technical lead and provided
                assistance to junior developers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built a diverse array of UI elements, such as main/landing/error
                views, virtualised lists, chat and sidebar.
              </li>
            </ul>
